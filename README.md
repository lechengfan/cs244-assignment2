## Group: Austin Poore and Tommy Fan

This repository contains our code to reproduce experiments from Jellyfish: Networking Data Centers Randomly

## Reproducing Figure 9

1. Open `build_topology.py` and set n to the number of desired switches and d to the number of inter-switch links
2. Run `python build_topology.py`
3. The plot should exist in the plots/ folder, and routes should be saved in pickled_routes
